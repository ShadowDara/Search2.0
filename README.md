# Index and Search Tool by ShadowDara
## Description
This project consists of two Python scripts designed to work together to manage and search through large directory structures efficiently:
- Indexing Script: Creates an index file listing all directories and files in a specified folder, including their sizes.
- Search Script: Searches the generated index file for specific terms and returns the full paths of matching files.
These tools are ideal for system administrators, developers, or anyone who needs a quick way to analyze and locate files in large file systems.
